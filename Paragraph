There is no single "best" cooking style, as the ideal method depends on personal preference and the desired outcome, but an effective style involves a combination of understanding ingredients, applying appropriate heat, and a creative approach to enhance flavor. Learning by doing, experimenting with different culinary techniques like poaching, simmering, or baking, and focusing on fresh components are key to developing your own best cooking style, whether aiming for simplicity, complexity, or a unique cultural expression.
